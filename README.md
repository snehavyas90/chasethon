Project Overview
Veritas: The Digital Citizenship Coach is an AI-powered web application designed to build students’ critical thinking skills and resilience against online misinformation. Instead of relying on static fact-checkers, Veritas acts like a “flight simulator for the internet,” where users practice identifying manipulation tactics in safe, AI-generated scenarios. The system provides personalized feedback, gamified progress tracking, and a scalable tool for educators to integrate digital literacy into their classrooms. This project was built with React.js, Node.js/Express, Firebase, and the OpenAI API.
